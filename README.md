<center>Our Calculus Project delves into the study of how rumors spread within a stable population</center>
group. To accomplish this we are using mathematical modeling to represent the spread
of information. The model aims to improve understanding on how to track the spread of
rumors and further on how to control it. The factors influencing the spread of rumors will
be defined in the project.
The project will incorporate graph theory and differential equations to model interactions
within a stable population.
The findings and conclusions of this project have implications for diverse fields, the project
aims to close the gap between a real-world social phenomena and its mathematical model .
